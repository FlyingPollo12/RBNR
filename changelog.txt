RBNR changelog

Version: 0.03
	- Added screen-fitting. Works for any window size and works in real-time
	- Added a place for ingame menus on both right and left of game window
	- Created basic menu screen with play button to launch game scene


Version: 0.02
	- Added scaling to the main node. Currently set to scale x:3 y:2
	- Added event listener for clicks. Clicking anywhere adds HORIZONTAL_WALL to the Structures tilemap at that position
		- This will replace any current Structures present on tilemap
		- Only places HORIZONTAL_WALL section
		- No rules in place to disallow, for example, building over mountains or in water!
	- Starting app logs a bunch of info regarding screen size and the like. Should be useful for getting more accurate scaling to <i>actually</i> fit screen
